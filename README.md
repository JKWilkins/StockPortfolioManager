# StockPortfolioManager
This active portfolio manager learns its trading strategy through a manually implemented random forest classifier, denoted as the Strategy Learner. Using historic technical indicators as inputs, I compare the performance of my active random forest trader to a simple heuristic model, denoted as Manual Strategy, and a Benchmark long position.

Running testlearner.py will output the png and txt files within the 'images' folder.
